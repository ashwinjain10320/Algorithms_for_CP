# Tower of hanoi
We are provided with 3 rods and r rings of different sizes and each ring is stacked on a source rod(assuming it as A) such that no bigger ring is above smaller one.  
The other 2 rods acts as helper rod (assuming it as B) and destination rod (assuming it as C).  
Our task is to transfer all rings from A to C following conditions as mentioned below.  
1.  One ring can be transferred at a time.
2.  No bigger ring can be stacked above smaller ring.
## Approach
This problem can be easily solved using recursion (ie any function calling itself bounded by boundary conditions).
