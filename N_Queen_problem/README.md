# N-Queen Problem
## Problem Statement:
We are provided with a chess board with n units of side length and we need to place n queens such that no two queens eliminate each other. We have to make sure that 2 queens must not reside in same row, same column and same diagonal.
## Approach
We made use of backtracking to make arrangements. All those arrangements that failed are being backtracked for new solution. We made sure to check further conditions and tried to find whether it is true or false. And thus that solution is being eliminated by bounding conditions.
